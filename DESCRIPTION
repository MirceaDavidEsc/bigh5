Title: Efficiently Access HDF5 Files Too Big for Memory
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mircea Davidescu

Description: This package helps in accessing large HDF5 files by providing
functions that allow a user to make a factor-based index of the HDF5 file.
Chunks of the HDF5 file can then be loaded based on this factor index map. This
type of functionality is especially useful when each factor has an uncertain
amount of data/observables associated with it. As an example,
consider a data frame that has the name of every living U.S. citizen in every year
since 1776. Of course, the number of people changes throughout time, so you cannot
use simple slicing and chunking operations that are a part of HDF5 base routines.
Instead, we can make an index based on the year, that specifies which range of indices in
the data correspond to which year. Then one can easily load, for example, everyone
alive in 1776 and in 1831, and any other year they wish, just by using this index.
